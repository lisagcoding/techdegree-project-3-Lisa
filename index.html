        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a graphic designer and illustrator who loves to work designing on the computer. I'm excited to be learning how to create websites to futher my career.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a professional illustrator and graphic artist for over 25 years. I am always trying to learn artistic techniques from the people I work with and from the internet.</p>
